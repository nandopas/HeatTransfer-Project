# HeatTransfer-Project

Project Description:
You are designing a condenser to be used in a 900 MW (electrical) coal-fired thermal power plant in the US. The inlet of the condenser must have steam quality fraction of 0.9 and condensation of the steam must occur at 8 kPa. River water at 20◦C will be used for condensation and the exit temperature of the cooling water will be 33◦C. Assume a typical value of efficiency for coal-fired power plants in US. Use Python and CoolProp for any simulations.
